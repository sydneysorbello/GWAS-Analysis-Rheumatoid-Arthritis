# GWAS-Analysis-Rheumatoid-Arthritis
This repository stores the code for a GWAS analysis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. This project was produced for the final project of Boston University's graduate level course BS859: Applied Genetic Analysis. The analysis follows pre-processing, PCA, sex-stratified GWAS, Meta-analysis, and LD Score Regression.

For a brief overview of the analysis in addition to some working figures please visit the wiki page!

For Full description of the analysis, please read the attached report 'BS859: Final_Paper_w_Code.pdf'
 
It is important to note the data used in this analysis was not my own and came from various sources as detailed in the write up. The work cited had futher been provided below:
